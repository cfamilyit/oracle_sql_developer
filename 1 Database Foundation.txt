Database Foundation
===================
Filesystem
==========
What is File?
============
--> is storage unit -- to store the data  permanently in a disk memory.
--> collection of raw data.
E.g:- employee.txt
      employee.csv 
	  employee.dat 
	  employee.doc
	  etc..
--> Every Operating system has "Filesystem" concept to create a files.	  

How to create files?
===================
In Windows Operating System 
---------------------------
notepad, notepad++, wordpad, msword, etc..

Linux/Unix,
----------
vi,vim,nano,cat,touch,gedit, etc..

Programming Languages
---------------------
--> Every Language has files concept to create files.
C,C++, Java, Python, Scala, etc..

Advantages of Files:-
===================
--> Every Operating System has filesystem concept in-built 
--> We can write data directly using different free softwares like 
    Windows: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, etc..
	Linux/Unix: cat,vi,nano etc..
--> No need to have any specialized skills to write data.	
--> to perform crud operations we will use programming languages 
    c -- create -- (create files and write data)
	r -- read
	u -- update/modify 
	d -- delete 
--> Every language has files concet to perform "crud" operations.	

dis-advantages of files:-
=======================
--> We need to know any programming like c,c++,java,python,scala or etc..
--> We need to write multiple programs for different purposes.
--> If structure is changed
    E.g:- initially empno type is int, later we are changing empno to string
	      salary  -- initially int later we want it as double
	we need to modify our programs 
--> If we want more columns, we need to change in many programs.
--> If you want to change data type 
    E.g: sal -- int later we want cahnge it to float
--> For every change in data, we have to change our applications/programs otherwise it will 
    not work.	
	
DBMS -- Database Management System
==================================
--> is a collection/set of programs or applications to manage software.
--> There are many DBMS software available in market. They are:
Oracle
MySQL
Microsoft SQLServer
IBM DB2
PostgreSQL
Sybase
SQ-Lite
Informix
Teradata
etc..

--> When ever we install DBMS Software some where in harddisk it automatically creates place
to store the data is called "Database".

--> Every DBMS Software provides user interface to interact with database.
--> By using Any Programming Language we can interact with DBMS.
--> Programming Languages like Java, Python, Scala,.Net etc uses Drivers to communicate with 
    DBMS.
--> We can also use thirdparty software to communicate with DBMS.
    E.g:  For Oracle --- Toad, SQL Developer, dbEver, etc..
          For MySQL  -- WOrkbench, phpMyAdmin, SQLyog, dbEver, etc..

What is Database?
================	
--> It is an organized collection of inter-related data.
        or 
    It is a collection of structred data.
        or 
    Is a collection of tables.
	
--> Every database has two types structures. They are 
1. Logical Structure 
2. Physical Structure	

Logical Structure:-
==================
--> The structure which is not visible in operating system.
--> Logical structure contains tables,views,sequences, synonyms etc..
--> Logical structures handled by Database Developers, Database Administrators.

Physical Structure:-
==================
--> The structure which is visible in Operating System 
--> These are handled by Database Administrators.
	
DBMS Architecture:
=================	
--> ANSI (American National Standard Institute) as established three levels of architecture 
for DBMS.
1. Conceptual Level
2. External Level 
3. Internal Level or Physical Level 

--> These three levels also called ANSI/SPARC(Standard Planning and Req Commite) architecture

Conceptual Level:-
================
--> It describes logical structure of database.
--> It will not describe how data is going to store in physical storage or in harddisk space.
--> It will defines what type of data can be stored in database by specifying each column 
    type of table using datatypes 
	E.g:- course(cid,cname,duration,fee)
	cid -- numeric 
	cname -- string 
	duration -- floating 
	fee -- floating
--> we will create relationships between different tables 
    students  -- courses
	trainers -- courses 
	etc..
	In Oracle -- Primary Key, Foriegn key
--> We will define what kind of data cannot be stored 
    In Oracle -- We have Key Constraints like Primary Key, Check, Unique, etc..)
	
External Level:-
==============
--> It describes users view of database.
--> It provides security through views.
    we are going to create different views for different uses.	
	
Internal Level:-
==============
--> indexes, cluster are used to manage and control the data in physical storage in harddisk.
--> Index -- Whenever we add indexs on database then table structure but performance will 
    improve.
	
Data Model:-
==========
--> How data is represented at the conceptual level defined by means data model.
--> In the history of database design there are 3types of data models. they are;
1. Hierarchical Model.
2. Network model.
3. Relational Model.

Hierarchical Model:-
------------------
--> It was introduced in 1960's 
--> In this model data orginized in "tree structure".It is like a table in relational model.
--> In this model data represents in the form records.
--> This model is implmented based on one-to-many relationship means one parent record may 
    have multiple child records.So many child records has one parent.
--> In this model child records are repeated multiple times. so we can see more duplicates.
--> Based on this Hierarchical Model, In 1960's IBM implemented "IMS", this uses procedural 
    language.	
	
Network Model:-
-------------
--> This model was introduced in 1970's.
--> This model was defined by CODASYL (Conference on Data System Language) Commitee.
--> This model has less duplicate data.
--> In this model relationship implmented based on many-to-many relationship.
--> In this models also data represents in records format.
--> In 1970's IBM introduced "IDMS" -- Information Data Management System software.
--> To operate this model we have to use procedural language.

Relational Model:-
----------------
--> In relational model data represents in tables.
--> It is a collection of relations. relation means table.
--> A Table is a collection of rows and columns.
--> In this relational model we have 3 components. They are:
    1. Collection of object (table,views,indexces,sequences,synonyms,cluster,etc..)
	2. Set of Operators
	3. Set of Integrity rules.
--> This model was invented in 1970's based on E.F Codd written a paper "Relational 
    Data Model for Large Shared Data Banks"
--> E.F Codd defined 12 rules for relational models -- Normalization.
--> We have different Normal Forms like 
    1NF
	2NF
	3NF
	Boys Codd NF
	etc..
--> Based on this paper many organizations implmented DBMS software like 
    IBM -- DB2
    Oracle Corporation -- Oracle 
    Microsoft -- MS SQL Server 
    etc..
